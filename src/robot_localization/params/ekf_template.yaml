odom0_nodelay: false

# [ADVANCED] When measuring one pose variable with two sensors, a situation can arise in which both sensors under-
# report their covariances. This can lead to the filter rapidly jumping back and forth between each measurement as they
# arrive. In these cases, it often makes sense to (a) correct the measurement covariances, or (b) if velocity is also
# measured by one of the sensors, let one sensor measure pose, and the other velocity. However, doing (a) or (b) isn't
# always feasible, and so we expose the differential parameter. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose
# data is converted to velocity data by differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then
# integrated as usual. NOTE: this only applies to sensors that provide pose measurements; setting differential to true
# for twist measurements has no effect.
odom0_differential: false

# [ADVANCED] When the node starts, if this parameter is true, then the first measurement is treated as a "zero point"
# for all future measurements. While you can achieve the same effect with the differential paremeter, the key
# difference is that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before
# integrating it. If you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true.

# [ADVANCED]  The EKF and UKF models follow a standard predict/correct cycle. During prediction, if there is no
# acceleration reference, the velocity at time t+1 is simply predicted to be the same as the velocity at time t. During
# correction, this predicted value is fused with the measured value to produce the new velocity estimate. This can be
# problematic, as the final velocity will effectively be a weighted average of the old velocity and the new one. When
# this velocity is the integrated into a new pose, the result can be sluggish covergence. This effect is especially
# noticeable with LIDAR data during rotations. To get around it, users can try inflating the process_noise_covariance
# for the velocity variable in question, or decrease the  variance of the variable in question in the measurement
# itself. In addition, users can also take advantage of the control command being issued to the robot at the time we
# make the prediction. If control is used, it will get converted into an acceleration term, which will be used during
# predicition. Note that if an acceleration measurement for the variable in question is available from one of the
# inputs, the control term will be ignored.

# [ADVANCED] The process noise covariance matrix can be difficult to tune, and can vary for each application, so it is
# exposed as a configuration parameter. This matrix represents the noise we add to the total error after each
# prediction step. The better the omnidirectional motion model matches your system, the smaller these values can be.
# However, if users find that a given variable is slow to converge, one approach is to increase the
# process_noise_covariance diagonal value for the variable in question, which will cause the filter's predicted error
# to be larger, which will cause the filter to trust the incoming measurement more during correction. The values are
# ordered as x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, vx, vy, vz, vroll, vpitch, vyaw, ax, ay, az. Defaults to the matrix below if
